RESTFull APIS are made using these 5 points.
1. Sepperate API into logical resources 
EX- tours for tout 
rides for rides

2.Expose structured resource-based URLs
EX- www.natours.com/tours

3.Use HTTP Methods(verbs)
There are five types of methods:
PUT - to update the resource with the whole object provided
GET -to read the resource
POST - to create a new object in the resource
PATCH - to update the resource with only some changes
DELETE - to delete an object from the resources

So these methods follow CRUD(Create, Read, Update, and Delete) Operations.


4. Send data as JSON(usually).

5. Be stateless meaning that all the states should be updated on the client side .The server should not have to remember previous request info.
